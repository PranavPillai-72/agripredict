Farmers throughout the world experience problems due to uncertainty about which crops to grow in which seasons, and thus do poorly and turn to losses.
Weather patterns that are not a usual season, an erratic market, and a lack of useful second-hand materials, hamper sensible choices.
Our team intends to make use of publicly available information to make a model that will be able to forecast crop production using rainfall, temperature, and pesticide application information.
This will provide the farmers with insights, enabling them to make gains from the optimum utilization of resources and management of their production risks.
